# Initial Project Setup

If using VS Code, you can use `Ctrl+Shift+F` to search and replace across the entire project.

Delete this section after the project has been initially set up:
1. Find and replace all instances of `MOD_TITLE` with the mod's name.
2. Find and replace all instances of `MOD_REPO` with the mod's name *and no spaces*.
   - This should be the name of the repository on GitHub.
3. Find and replace all instances of `MOD_PREFIX` with the mod's prefix.
   - This should be all lowercase.
4. Find and replace all instances of `MOD_ACRONYM` with the mod's acronym.
   - This should be all uppercase.
5. After the initial Steam upload, find and replace all instances of `MOD_ID` with the mod's Steam Workshop id.
